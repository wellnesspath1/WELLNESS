      <div class="article-body">
        <section class="habit" id="habit-water">
          <h3>1. Start with a glass of water</h3>
          <p class="why"><span class="label">Why it helps:</span> While you sleep your body loses fluids. Rehydrating first thing supports digestion, circulation, brain performance, and helps you wake up feeling more alert.</p>
          <p class="how"><span class="label">How to do it:</span> Keep a glass or a 300–500 ml bottle by your bedside and drink it within the first 15 minutes after waking. Plain water is best; add lemon or a pinch of salt if you prefer.</p>
          <p class="variation"><span class="label">Fast alternative:</span> Warm water (or warm water with lemon) can be gentler on the stomach and help digestion.</p>
          <p class="tip"><span class="label">Stick tip:</span> Make drinking water the first item in a short chain—drink, then brush your teeth. Set out a filled glass before bed so it’s effortless in the morning.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="habit" id="habit-stretch">
          <h3>2. Move with 5–10 minutes of gentle stretching</h3>
          <p class="why"><span class="label">Why it helps:</span> Simple stretches stimulate circulation, loosen tight muscles, increase mobility, and reduce stiffness and morning discomfort.</p>
          <p class="how"><span class="label">How to do it:</span> Try a compact routine: 30 seconds neck rolls, 30 seconds shoulder rolls, 1 minute cat-cow, 1 minute forward fold, 2 minutes lunges/hip openers, and 1 minute gentle twists. Breathe mindfully throughout.</p>
          <p class="variation"><span class="label">Fast alternative:</span> A short sun-salutation flow or seated stretches work if you have limited space.</p>
          <p class="tip"><span class="label">Stick tip:</span> Keep a mat beside your bed or set a brief timer. Five focused minutes beats skipping entirely.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="habit" id="habit-protein">
          <h3>3. Eat a protein-focused breakfast</h3>
          <p class="why"><span class="label">Why it helps:</span> Protein steadies blood sugar, keeps you fuller longer, stabilizes energy, and supports muscle health.</p>
          <p class="how"><span class="label">How to do it:</span> Aim for 15–30 grams of protein. Options include Greek yogurt with nuts and berries, scrambled eggs with veggies, a protein smoothie with milk and spinach, or cottage cheese with fruit and toast topped with nut butter.</p>
          <p class="variation"><span class="label">Fast alternative:</span> If you’re not hungry immediately, grab a high-protein snack like a boiled egg, protein bar, or shake within an hour.</p>
          <p class="tip"><span class="label">Stick tip:</span> Prep ingredients the night before — chop vegetables, portion yogurt, or make overnight oats with added protein.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="habit" id="habit-walk">
          <h3>4. Take a short walk</h3>
          <p class="why"><span class="label">Why it helps:</span> A 10–20 minute walk increases blood flow, boosts mood through endorphins, sharpens creativity, and exposes you to natural light which helps regulate your circadian rhythm.</p>
          <p class="how"><span class="label">How to do it:</span> Walk around the block, through a nearby park, or simply pace outside your building. Keep a comfortable, brisk pace.</p>
          <p class="variation"><span class="label">Fast alternative:</span> If going outside isn’t possible, march in place, climb stairs, or walk around your home while on a call.</p>
          <p class="tip"><span class="label">Stick tip:</span> Pair the walk with something enjoyable — listen to a podcast, practice gratitude, or observe your surroundings mindfully.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="habit" id="habit-mind">
          <h3>5. Practice a short mindfulness exercise or journaling</h3>
          <p class="why"><span class="label">Why it helps:</span> Mindfulness lowers stress and enhances focus; journaling organizes your thoughts, clarifies priorities, and increases self-awareness.</p>
          <p class="how"><span class="label">How to do it:</span> Mindfulness — spend 3–10 minutes focusing on your breath and letting thoughts pass without judgment. Journaling — free-write for 3–10 minutes using prompts like “Three things I’m grateful for,” “My priorities today,” or “How do I feel right now?”</p>
          <p class="variation"><span class="label">Fast alternative:</span> Do a 3-minute breath practice and then write a single sentence with your intention for the day.</p>
          <p class="tip"><span class="label">Stick tip:</span> Keep a small notebook and pen at your breakfast table, or use a guided meditation app for consistent, short sessions.</p>

        <section class="routine">
          <h4>Putting the habits together: a compact routine</h4>
          <p class="small">Minimal (15 minutes): Drink water → 5 min stretch → 3 min journaling → quick protein snack. Full (25–40 min): Drink water → 5–8 min stretch → 3–5 min mindfulness/journaling → 5–10 min protein breakfast → 10–20 min walk.</p>

        <section>
          <h4>Tips for making habits stick</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Start small: focus on one or two habits and add others after 2–3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Habit stacking: attach a new habit to something you already do (after brushing teeth, stretch).</li>
            <li>Night-before prep: lay out clothes, prepare breakfast ingredients, and fill your water glass.</li>
            <li>Be flexible: when time is tight, do a 2-minute abbreviated version instead of skipping.</li>
            <li>Track progress: use a habit tracker, calendar checkmarks, or a short journal to celebrate streaks.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Sample quick routines</h4>
          <p class="small">10-min shortcut: Drink water → 5-min stretch → 3-min journaling → 1-min snack prep. 25-min energizer: Drink water → 7-min yoga/stretch → 10-min walk → protein smoothie.</p>
        </section>

        <p class="muted small">Small, consistent morning actions compound over time. You don’t need perfection — choose simple, repeatable steps and build from there.</p>
